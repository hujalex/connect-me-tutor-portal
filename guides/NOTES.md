# what i changed (jan 2026)

## session exit form not saving

what you were seeing
- after submit, the database column `session_exit_form` in the `sessions` table looked like it stayed empty.

what was actually happening
- the tutor submit flow was doing two writes:
	- it wrote notes
	- then it called `updateSession(updatedSession)` and that second write overwrote `session_exit_form` back to `null` because `updatedSession.session_exit_form` was unset

exact code change
- file: [components/tutor/dashboard/TutorDashboard.tsx](components/tutor/dashboard/TutorDashboard.tsx)
- function: `handleSessionComplete(updatedSession, notes, isQuestionOrConcern, isFirstSession)`
- changed this line:
	- from: `await recordSessionExitForm(updatedSession.id, notes);`
	- to: `updatedSession.session_exit_form = notes;`
- reason: `updateSession(updatedSession)` updates `session_exit_form` too, so we need `updatedSession.session_exit_form` to be correct before calling it

what was missing
- the ui existed but the inputs were not wired to state and `handleProfileSubmit` did not write to the database
